# Mental Health in the Teach Industry

## **Project Overview**
**Criteria for the project:** Does the tech industry support mental health?
        
**The revelance of the project:**Â  Mental health in the workplace is atracting more attention now more than ever before. There are growing concerns that the taboo of mental health has not yet been eradicated despite countless campaigns, new laws and regulations protecting the workforce in regards to their mental health. On the other hand, technology is the world's biggest industry, most valuable industry, and the most profitable. As such, it employees the most number of workers and caters to every other industry in the world, be it health, finance, military etc. tech products and services are the driving force behind them (PWC Global, 2016). This project seeks to analyse data to conclude if there is enough support in the tech industry for its employees' mental health.

This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health in the workplace by OSMI 2014.

**Limitations of the data:** When it comes to comparing tech and non-tech companies, the distribution of companies used was not a fair balance between the two. Also, the survey in itself is not a fair representation of the entire tech industries and does not take into account the types of different organisations that can be calssififed as a tech company, e.g. one that operates in logistics vs social media. 
In addition the data is biased towards a certain region of the world, which has influenced the data.

**Questions and Methodolgy:**
1. Find out if there is a correlation between companies that offer wellness programs and employees who suffer from mental health issues.
2. Find out if there is a link between tech industires and non-tech industries who offer mental health wellness programs.
3. Investigate if there are any demographic difference/trends in the tech space that offer wellness programs, there are more/less consequences for taking time off for mental health, and ? 
4. Are there any gender trends to be noted within the tech industry, as we suspect women are probably more likely to suffer from mental health in this industry?


 
**Recommendations:** Suggestions of practices/initiatives tech companies can take to better aid their employees' mental health?

## **Analysis and Findings**

Based on this study, the analysis for all research questions suggests that the provisions in tech industry are not adequate for mental health issues yet. The findings and insights of this research should be generalized with caution as the survey respondents may not be a fair representation of the entire population in the tech industry and workplaces.
In addition, it shows that companies in North Americas and Europe offer better and more mental health support compared to the rest of the world.
